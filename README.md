# ArtWebApp
### A Spring MVC website, destined to art passionated that allow users to perfom Style Transfer using Neural Networks.

Recent advancements in image processing field has produced results in almost
every field, including art, which has been viewed as a pantheon of humanity. Papers
like “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style” presents techniques for artistic style
transfer from a painting to an image using Convolutional Neural Networks. In this
project we propose to build a fully deployable website around those techniques using
Spring MVC framework. It’s main functionality is allowing the users to upload their
images and choose what available painting style they want to transfer to it.
